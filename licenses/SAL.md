# Source Availability License (SAL)

Version 1.0  
Inspired by MariaDB Business Source License 1.1, modified

---

## 0\. Purpose

This License is a source-available license intended to permit access to source code and related materials for development, testing, and evaluation purposes, while reserving production use and broader commercial exploitation for separate authorization.

This License is not an open source license and is not intended to comply with the Open Source Definition.

---

## 1\. Definitions

“Repository” means the code repository to which this License is applied.

“Licensed IP” means all copyrightable and related intellectual property contained in the Repository that is made available under this License, including but not limited to software code, documentation, data, media, and images, excluding any material governed by a separate license as described in Section 8\.

“Contributor” means any individual or entity that contributes material to the Repository.

“Copyright Holder” means any Contributor that owns copyright or related rights in their contribution and has made such contribution available under this License.

“You” (or “Your”) means an individual or legal entity exercising permissions granted by this License.

“Production Use” means use of the Licensed IP in a live, operational, or revenue-generating environment, or to provide services to third parties, including but not limited to use in production systems, hosted services, or commercial offerings.

“TIPL Tender Offer” means the governance and authorization mechanism described in a separate, publicly available document designated by the Repository, under which holders of a specified cryptographic token may collectively approve actions relating to this License, including amendments, interpretations, or replacement versions. The TIPL Tender Offer confers governance authority only and does not convey ownership, partnership, fiduciary, or agency rights in the Licensed IP.

---

## 2\. Grant of Rights (Non-Production)

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Copyright Holder hereby grants You a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to:

* Copy the Licensed IP  
* Modify the Licensed IP  
* Create derivative works of the Licensed IP  
* Redistribute the Licensed IP and derivative works  
* Make non-production use of the Licensed IP

Production Use is expressly excluded from this grant.

---

## 3\. Additional Use Grant (Production Rights)

Production Use of the Licensed IP is permitted only if expressly authorized by an Additional Use Grant.

An Additional Use Grant, if any, shall be listed below or otherwise clearly designated by the Repository.

Additional Use Grant:  
*None*

Unless and until an Additional Use Grant is made, no rights for Production Use are granted under this License.

---

## 4\. Use Conditions and Limitations

You may not use the Licensed IP in violation of applicable law.

Except as expressly granted in Sections 2 and 3, no additional rights or field-of-use permissions are granted.

---

## 5\. No Change Date; No Automatic License Conversion

This License does not include a change date and does not automatically convert into another license.

All rights granted under this License remain governed exclusively by this License unless and until modified pursuant to a valid TIPL Tender Offer.

---

## 6\. Contributions and Representations

Each Contributor represents that, to the best of their knowledge:

* They have the legal authority to license their contribution under this License; and  
* Their contribution does not knowingly infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties.

Contributions are not assigned to any central licensor or legal entity. Each Copyright Holder retains ownership of their respective contributions.

---

## 7\. License Modification and Governance

This License may be modified, amended, or replaced only pursuant to approval obtained through a valid TIPL Tender Offer.

Unless expressly stated otherwise, any modification:

* Applies prospectively only; and  
* Does not retroactively revoke or impair rights granted under prior versions of this License, except as required by applicable law.

Continued use, reproduction, or distribution of the Licensed IP after publication of a modified License constitutes acceptance of the modified terms.

The authoritative description of the TIPL Tender Offer is maintained outside this License and may be updated independently. References to the TIPL Tender Offer refer to its current version as designated by the Repository.

---

## 8\. Third-Party and Open Source Materials

The Repository may include materials governed by separate open source or proprietary licenses.

This License does not supersede, limit, or revoke any rights granted under such licenses. Where a file or component is governed by a separate license, that license controls exclusively for that material.

---

## 9\. Sublicensing and Redistribution

You may redistribute the Licensed IP or derivative works only under the terms of this License or a later version approved pursuant to a TIPL Tender Offer, except where a separate license applies.

Redistribution does not imply or grant Production Use rights.

---

## 10\. No Partnership or Fiduciary Relationship

Nothing in this License or in the TIPL Tender Offer shall be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, agency, fiduciary, decentralized autonomous organization, or employment relationship among any parties, including Contributors, token holders, or users of the Licensed IP.

---

## 11\. Disclaimer of Warranty

THE LICENSED IP IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

---

## 12\. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS LICENSE OR THE LICENSED IP.

---

## 13\. Termination

This License terminates automatically if You materially breach its terms and fail to cure the breach within a reasonable period after becoming aware of it.

Upon termination, You must cease use of the Licensed IP, except for materials governed by separate licenses that permit continued use.

---

## 14\. Survival

Sections relating to disclaimers, limitation of liability, attribution, and interpretation survive termination of this License.

---

## 15\. Neutral Jurisdiction

This License is intended to be interpreted in a jurisdiction-neutral manner. No specific governing law or forum is designated.

If a governing law must be applied, it shall be the law most closely connected to the transaction, excluding conflict-of-law principles.

---

## 16\. Attribution

This License shall be referenced as:
